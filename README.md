## Capabilities

I build and operate end-to-end systems that combine **software engineering**, **data pipelines**, and **AI/ML analysis**.  

### Technical Stack & Core Skills
- **Python Engineering**
  - Pandas Â· NumPy Â· Matplotlib Â· Seaborn  
  - Data wrangling, statistical modeling, anomaly detection  
  - Automated ETL pipelines (extract, transform, load) from raw data  
- **Dashboards & Visualization**
  - Build visual reports and interactive dashboards for insights  
  - Translate datasets into meaningful business intelligence  
- **Applied AI/ML**
  - Proof-of-signal systems (identify trends, detect anomalies, validate models)  
  - Integrate models into apps and real-world workflows  
- **Systems Mindset**
  - From command line tools (CLI) to modern APIs  
  - Can build apps, APIs, or dashboards as standalone solutions  

### Example: Anomaly Detection
Demonstrated ability to:  
- Create and process datasets  
- Apply statistical methods (z-score, thresholds)  
- Detect outliers and visualize results  
- Communicate findings through clean, interpretable plots  

## Vision
Amanda Perez Systems exists to turn **raw data into signal**.  
From personal pipelines (Spotify + Apple Health) to enterprise dashboards,  
I focus on **building systems that prove, visualize, and operationalize insight.**
