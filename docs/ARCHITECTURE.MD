###System Architecture
#Stack
Frontend: React (PWA, scalable to iOS/Android)
Backend: Flask or FastAPI (Python-based REST API)
Database: SQLite (dev) → PostgreSQL (prod)

#Data Layer: Pandas, NumPy for ETL pipelines (Spotify API, Apple Health exports, CSV/JSON ingestion)

#Visualization Layer: Interactive dashboards (Matplotlib, Seaborn, or React chart libraries)

#AI/ML Layer: Proof-of-signal systems (trend detection, anomaly detection, applied models)

###Flow
#Data Ingestion
Sources: Spotify API, Apple Health exports, manual CSV/JSON uploads

#Transformation & Cleaning
Pandas pipelines for structuring raw input into usable datasets

#Analysis & ML
Statistical methods + anomaly detection (NumPy, Pandas, custom models)

#Backend API Layer
Flask/FastAPI exposes endpoints for workout logging, progress tracking, PRs

#Frontend Delivery
React frontend serves mobile-friendly UI (accessible via browser link on iPhone/Android)

#Visualization & Dashboards
User dashboards for workouts, trends, anomalies

#Deployment
Render/Heroku (backend) + Netlify/Vercel (frontend) → single public link

###Notes
#CLI tools (workout_logger, rest_timer) remain as developer utilities and prototyping tools.
#MVP goal: User can log workouts from their phone, see progress dashboards, and compare performance trends.
#Scalability: Add user authentication (OAuth), Stripe integration for subscriptions, and expand DB schema as adoption grows.
