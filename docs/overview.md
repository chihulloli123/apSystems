Overview
Amanda Perez Systems

Turning raw data into meaningful performance insights

Executive Summary

Amanda Perez Systems (apSystems) builds applications that transform personal data into actionable intelligence. Starting with fitness and health, we integrate data pipelines, dashboards, and applied AI/ML to create scalable systems for individuals and organizations.

Our first product is a Workout Logger & Performance Dashboard, designed to help athletes and everyday users track workouts, detect trends, and hit personal records. The platform connects with Spotify (training playlists), Apple Health (metrics), and manual workout inputs to provide a complete view of performance.

This project demonstrates not only the technical foundation — Python engineering, ETL pipelines, visualization, and anomaly detection — but also the capacity to scale into broader applications in health, training, and enterprise analytics.

Mission

To empower people with data-driven insights that improve performance, health, and decision-making.

Vision

By leveraging pipelines, dashboards, and applied AI, apSystems will grow into a full-stack solutions provider that combines technical depth with accessible user experiences. We aim to expand beyond individual users into coaches, gyms, and organizations, eventually scaling toward enterprise-grade analytics platforms.

Core Differentiators

Systems-first approach: Built from the ground up with pipelines, data cleaning, and visualization at the center.

Scalable design: MVP starts as a mobile-friendly PWA; roadmap expands to native apps and enterprise dashboards.

Applied AI/ML: Proof-of-signal methods (trend detection, anomaly detection) validate data insights in real-world use cases.

Founder-led expertise: Decade of experience in systems analysis, software engineering, and operations management.
